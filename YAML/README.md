# 📘 Introduction to YAML

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a **human-readable data serialization language** commonly used in **DevOps** workflows and tools. It serves as a simplified alternative to JSON and XML, offering ease of use for configuration and data exchange between systems and humans.

## ✅ Why YAML?
- 📄 **Readable** and **writable** by humans, making configuration management straightforward.
- 🔧 Widely used in **DevOps tools** such as **Docker Compose**, **Kubernetes**, and **Ansible**.
- 🔁 Supports various data types for flexible configuration options.
- 🧩 File extensions: `.yaml` or `.yml`.

# 🔠 Data Types in YAML

| Data Type     | Description                                                                 | Example                            |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Boolean**   | Represented as `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`                   | `is_active: true`                  |
| **Numbers**   | Supports integers, floats, decimals, exponential, octal, and hexadecimal   | `port: 8080`, `price: 4.99`        |
| **String**    | Can be quoted or unquoted. Double quotes support escape characters         | `name: "John"`, `city: London`     |
| **Multi-line**| `>` folds lines into a single string, `|` preserves newlines                | `description: >`<br>`Line one`     |
| **Null**      | Represented as `null` or `~`                                                | `value: null`                      |
| **List**      | Ordered sequence, represented with hyphens                                 | `- apple`<br>`- banana`            |
| **Dictionary**| Key-value pairs (maps)                                                      | `person:`<br>`  name: Alice`       |
| **Set**       | Unique unordered elements, denoted with `?` (less common)                  | `? a`<br>`? b`                     |

# 🧱 Syntax and Examples

### ✅ Basic Syntax
- Key-value pairs use a colon `:` and space  
  ```yaml
  name: John
  age: 30
  ```
- Indentation uses **spaces only** (no tabs!)
- Structure is defined by indentation
- Keys must be strings; values can be any data type

### ✅ Lists
```yaml
fruits:
  - Apple
  - Banana
  - Cherry
```

### ✅ Dictionaries (Nested)
```yaml
person:
  name: Alice
  age: 25
  address:
    city: New York
    zip: 10001
```

### ✅ Multi-line Strings
```yaml
# Folded (newlines become spaces)
description: >
  This is a multi-line
  string that will be folded
  into a single line.

# Literal (preserve newlines)
note: |
  Line one
  Line two
  Line three
```

### ✅ Null and Booleans
```yaml
active: true
status: null
```

# ⚙️ YAML in DevOps Tools

### 🚢 Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

### ☸️ Kubernetes Manifest
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mycontainer
      image: nginx
```

### ⚙️ Ansible Playbook
```yaml
- name: Install packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure latest version of nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: latest
```

# 🔄 YAML Interoperability

- ✅ Convert YAML to **JSON** or **XML** using [online converters](https://json2yaml.com/)
- 📚 Read/write YAML files in **Python** using the `PyYAML` library:
  ```python
  import yaml

  with open("config.yaml") as f:
      config = yaml.safe_load(f)
  ```

# ♻️ Advanced Features

### 🔗 Anchors & Aliases
Re-use values:
```yaml
defaults: &default_settings
  retries: 3
  timeout: 30

service1:
  <<: *default_settings
  url: http://example.com
```

### 🔧 Templates & Placeholders
Used in tools like **Helm charts** for Kubernetes:
```yaml
replicaCount: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
```

# 🎯 Conclusion

YAML is a powerful yet easy-to-read configuration language ideal for DevOps workflows. By learning its syntax, data types, and use cases in popular tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible, you can efficiently manage complex deployments and configurations.
