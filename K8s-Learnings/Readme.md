# ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes - A Container Orchestration Platform

---

## üìå What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes** is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Containers are **ephemeral** by nature ‚Äî they can be short-lived and prone to failures. Kubernetes solves critical real-world production issues such as:

## üõ†Ô∏è Problems Kubernetes Solves (Compared to Docker)

| Problem | Docker Limitation | Kubernetes Solution |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 1. **Resource Conflicts on a Single Host** | Containers share host resources, and excessive usage can crash others. | Kubernetes distributes containers across multiple nodes to balance resources. |
| 2. **No Auto-Healing** | If a container is accidentally stopped or crashes, Docker doesn‚Äôt restart it. | Kubernetes monitors and automatically restarts failed containers. |
| 3. **Lack of Auto-Scaling or Load Balancing** | Docker doesn‚Äôt natively support scaling or traffic routing. | Kubernetes supports auto-scaling and built-in load balancing across pods. |
| 4. **Enterprise-Level Support** | Docker doesn‚Äôt provide enterprise-grade networking, firewalling, or storage. | Kubernetes provides APIs, RBAC, service discovery, storage integration, and more. |

## üß± Docker vs Kubernetes Architecture ‚Äì Real-World Production Comparison

### üö¢ Docker Architecture (Single Host)

Docker is used to **build, ship, and run containers**. Its core building block is the **container**, and to run containers, it requires a **container runtime**.

- In earlier versions, Docker used a component called `dockershim` to interface with Kubernetes. However, **`dockershim` has been deprecated and removed**. Kubernetes now interacts directly with runtimes like **`containerd`** or **CRI-O**, which follow the [Container Runtime Interface (CRI)].
- Docker manages containers using the **Docker Engine**, which includes:
  - Docker Daemon: Runs in the background and manages containers.
  - Docker CLI: Command-line interface to interact with the daemon.
  - Docker Image: A snapshot of your application with all dependencies.
- Containers run on a **single machine**, and resources are shared among them.

**Limitation Example**:
Imagine you‚Äôre running a Node.js backend and a React frontend on Docker:
- If the Node container uses too much CPU, the React container might crash.
- There's no auto-restart or load balancing.
- It's limited to one host ‚Äî no clustering or multi-node deployment.

## üöÄ Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes architecture is based on a **master-worker** (control plane-data plane) model.

![Diagram-55](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8a4d71-b168-4ff3-bd62-1d84f57d6333)

### üß† Control Plane (Master)

Responsible for **cluster-wide decisions** like scheduling, scaling, and health monitoring.

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| **API Server** | Central control component. Receives all requests and communicates with other components. |
| **Scheduler** | Decides **which node** runs a pod based on resource availability. |
| **Controller Manager** | Handles replication, node health, and scaling. Manages **ReplicaSets**, **Deployments**, etc. |
| **etcd** | A distributed key-value store that holds cluster state and configuration. |
| **Cloud Controller Manager (CCM)** | Integrates Kubernetes with cloud providers (e.g., AWS, GCP). Manages load balancers, storage, etc. |

### üîß Data Plane (Worker Nodes)

Worker nodes are where containers actually run. Each node has:

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| **kubelet** | Responsible for pod creation and communication with the control plane. |
| **kube-proxy** | Handles networking, service discovery, and **load balancing** inside the cluster. |
| **Container Runtime** | Software to run containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O). Required for pod execution. |

---

## üì¶ Why is Control Plane Needed?

Even though pods and containers run on **worker nodes**, Kubernetes needs a **centralized intelligence system** to:

- Decide **where** to place a pod (Node 1 or Node 2)
- Ensure **auto-scaling** and **self-healing**
- Interface with cloud resources (via CCM)
- Maintain **high availability** and consistency across the cluster

## üîÑ Core Concepts in Kubernetes

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pods** | Smallest deployable unit, can contain one or more containers |
| **ReplicaSet** | Ensures the desired number of pods are always running |
| **Deployment** | Declarative update of ReplicaSets and pods |
| **Services** | Abstraction to expose a set of pods as a network service |
| **Namespaces** | Virtual clusters within a physical cluster for isolation |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

Kubernetes is the **go-to platform** for running containerized applications in production. It addresses all the limitations of Docker by providing:

- Clustering
- Load balancing
- Auto-scaling
- Auto-healing
- Enterprise-grade networking
- Cloud integration

For modern DevOps and cloud-native environments, Kubernetes is a must-know tool.

---

## What is a Pod?
- In Kubernetes, the **Pod** is the smallest and most basic deployable unit.
- A Pod defines how to run one or more containers that share storage/network.
- In Docker, you'd use a command like:
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name demo -p 8080:8080 --network=mern -it demo-frontend
  ```
  This includes all run-time details via command line.
- In Kubernetes, this info is defined in a YAML manifest file (e.g., `pod.yaml`), making configuration declarative and reusable.

### kubectl
- `kubectl` is the command line interface to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

## Why Use YAML?
- Kubernetes uses YAML files for declarative configuration ‚Äî meaning you describe the desired state, and Kubernetes maintains it.

## Kubernetes Cluster Types
- **Minikube**: CLI tool to create a local Kubernetes cluster.
- **K3s**, **kind**: Lightweight Kubernetes clusters for testing/dev environments.
- **KOPS**: Used to create production-grade Kubernetes clusters on cloud platforms like AWS.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Tools
- Install `kubectl` CLI.
- Install `minikube`.
- Install virtualization driver (e.g., `hyperkit`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Workflow 

Sample pod.yaml: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/pods/simple-pod.yaml

### Start Minikube Cluster
```bash
minikube start
```
- Starts your local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

### Create a Pod (For Learning Only)
```bash
kubectl apply -f simple-pod.yaml
```
- Deploys a basic pod defined in YAML.

### Check Pod Status
```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

### View Detailed Pod Info
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

### Delete a Pod
```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Difference: Container vs Pod vs Deployment

- **Container**: Built using a Dockerfile and run via CLI (e.g., `docker run ...`).
- **Pod**:
  - Uses Docker image.
  - Specifications are provided in a `.yaml` manifest.
  - Can include multiple containers that share the same network and storage volumes.
- **Deployment**:
  - Provides auto-healing, scaling, and rollout capabilities.
  - A `deployment.yaml` file is recommended over a plain `pod.yaml`.
  - Structure:
    ```
    Deployment
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ReplicaSet
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pod(s)
    ```
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Creating Pods Directly
- While it is useful for basic learning, creating pods directly with a `pod.yaml` is not recommended for production or scalable applications.
- Pods created manually are not automatically restarted or replaced if they fail.
- To benefit from features like:
  - Auto-restart (self-healing)
  - Scaling
  - Rolling updates and rollbacks
  - Consistent state management

  You should use a **Deployment**, defined in a `deployment.yaml` file. 

### ReplicaSet vs Deployment
- **ReplicaSet** ensures a specified number of Pods are running (auto-healing).
- **Deployment** manages ReplicaSets and provides updates, rollbacks, etc.

## Notes
- Kubernetes automatically assigns sequential IP addresses to new pods.
- ‚ùó Avoid manually creating pods; use `deployment.yaml` for resilience, scaling, and best practices.

#### Apply Deployment
Sample deployment.yaml: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
- Creates a Deployment that manages ReplicaSets and Pods.

#### View Resources
```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get replicasets
kubectl get pods
```

#### Test Auto-Healing
```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```
- Kubernetes will recreate the pod automatically.

### üîç Other Useful Commands

- List all resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  kubectl get all -A
  ```
- Check cluster nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
- SSH into Minikube node:
  ```bash
  minikube ssh
  ```
